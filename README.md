There are 10 data sets (5 in folder a and 5  in fold b) in the attached zip file. Each data set has a training subset (for example, ‘Train_1a.csv’) and a test subset (for example, ‘Train_1a.csv’).  Build a regression model using the training subset and apply the model to the test subset. Each row in a data file is a sample. The training data files contain the desired outputs. The headers of the data files indicate the feature columns and the output columns. The test files do not contain the outputs. Save all your prediction results in a file named “hw4_result.csv” using the provided template file “hw4_result.csv”.  The order of the predictions in the result file should be the same to the order of their samples in the test file.
